## Introduction
72% of U.S smartphone users use less than 7 apps in a day. In response to this consumer behavior, the social platforms that we all know and love have started letting companies build chatbots with them.

 The chatbot can talk to you through different channels, such as Facebook Messenger, Siri, WeChat, Twitter, SMS, Slack, Skype, among others. 23.5 trillion WhatsApp messages sent every year. Twitter also holds a huge influence in the electronic messaging space. For example, there were 103 million tweets sent about the Winter Olympic Games and, in total, this led to 33.6 billion Impressions (views on and off Twitter) of tweets.

So first I wanted to explore if I would be able to predict a response to a general question given the dataset.
## Data 
The data I used was consumer twitter question and response dataset froma kaggle. The data consisted of 7 columns </p> 

<code>tweet_id  author_id	inbound  created_at text response_tweet_id in_response_to_tweet_id</code>
